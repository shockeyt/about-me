# about-me

## All about me

## a) 
Before GA I was a technical specialist/project manager for live event production.  I mainly worked in the audio and video departments setting up line arrays, rigs, video projection, etc.  Before that I was a data security tech focusing on resetting and clearing servers/networking equipment/computers of previous company info and resetting them to factory spec.

## b) 
I need skills and advice on getting hired in a webdev job quickly.  Financially, I don't have much money to survive too long after graduation, so speed is key.  Also, I REALLY want help finding the right work culture fit for myself (environment is important).

## c) 
Personal goal: Build an interactive music player.  
General Goal: Be a swiss-army knife of webdev.

## c.1)	
1.  I have many synths and guitars in my basement
2.  I have a basement
3.  I have a giant fluffy dog
